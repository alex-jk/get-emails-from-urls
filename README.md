# get-emails-from-urls
Get email addresses from urls using python
This code uses an input text query and then performs a Google search in order to obtain a list of urls based on the query.
The urls are then scraped for email addresses, as well as any linked urls (can set the limit for the number of initial urls and the number of linked urls). The output is a unique list of email addresses.
